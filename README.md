# Pyramid Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification

This repository implements a **Pyramid Hierarchical Spatial-Spectral Transformer (PHSS-Transformer)** for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification.  
The model leverages **spatial-spectral attention** and **hierarchical feature learning** to achieve high accuracy on benchmark datasets such as *Indian Pines* and *Pavia University*.
